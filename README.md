# Gamma-Ray-Event-Classification-using-MAGIC-Telescope-Data
Machine learning–based classification of gamma-ray and hadronic events using Hillas parameters, PCA, and ROC-driven evaluation on the MAGIC telescope dataset.

*Dataset Description :

(i)The dataset contains events recorded by a gamma-ray telescope, where each event is either a gamma ray (a real signal from space) or a hadron (background noise caused by other cosmic particles).

Hardron->Produce wider, irregular, and less aligned ellipses due to more chaotic particle showers.
/Gamma->ray events: Produce narrow, elongated ellipses that are more regular and aligned toward the camera center.

(ii)Each record describes the shape and intensity of light produced in the atmosphere, which helps distinguish true gamma events from unwanted hadronic events.

*Real-World Problem It Solves:

(i)Gamma-ray telescopes capture far more hadron (noise) events than real gamma rays, making it difficult to identify true cosmic signals.

(ii)This project helps automatically separate gamma rays from hadrons, improving the accuracy of astronomical observations and discoveries.

Note: Even though gamma rays are more in the dataset, it’s still perfect for learning how to separate gamma vs hadrons and for building ML models.
